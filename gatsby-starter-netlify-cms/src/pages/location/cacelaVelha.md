    header: "A Must Visit Location During Your Stay…"
    text: "Steeped in history, the tiny whitewashed village of Cacela Velha sits proudly on coastal cliffs offering vistas across gleaming lagoons to the vast Atlantic Ocean beyond. Settled since Phoenician times and an important outpost for the Moors, there is much to discover along the cobbled streets including the pocket-sized fort, the ancient church and a fascinating cemetery!
    
    Cuisine: Despite its size, several cafes and restaurants can be found dotted about the village with a greater selection in nearby Manta Rota and Vila Nova de Cacela."

    text: "By the cemetery take the steps down to the lagoon. At low tide, cross on foot or catch the fishing boat to reach one of the Algarve’s finest beaches of soft golden sands and clear blue waters. The views from the church are some of the finest in the East Algarve."
