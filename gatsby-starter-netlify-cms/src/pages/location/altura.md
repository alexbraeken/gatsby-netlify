    text: "This pocket-sized seaside town, popular with Portuguese tourists, offers expansive dune backed Blue Flag beaches and an array of tempting eateries, serving freshly caught fish and seafood. Unassuming and conveniently located between charming Tavira and the handsome frontier town of Vila Real do Santo António, Altura is ideally positioned to enjoy the many attractions of this lesser-known part of the Algarve. With a choice of supermarkets, cafes, bars, restaurants and other amenities on your doorstep, then use of a car is not essential while airport transfers can be easily arranged
    
    Cuisine: Dotted around this typical Portuguese town, a varied and enticing mix of restaurants serve sumptuous dishes, many with very reasonably priced ‘dish of the day’ offerings. At the beach, two popular beach eateries compete for your attention by the long boardwalk down to the shoreline, while at nearby exclusive Praia Verde, refined dining can be found enjoying tremendous ocean views."

    header: "Local Beach"
    text: "With a Blue Flag status ensuring high standards and facilities, and with a softly sloping shelf into the clean blue waters of the Atlantic Ocean, then it is clear to see why Altura is a popular family destination. Stretching East, long walks can be taken along the soft shoreline taking in the other equally splendid beaches of Praia Verde and Cabeco, then onto ever popular Monte Gordo. Heading West, the sands stretch as far as the eye can see, merging effortlessly into the vast Ria Formosa Natural Park. The summer brings a super selection of water sports."
