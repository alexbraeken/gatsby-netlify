    text: "Manta Rota is a small village which is very popular with the Portuguese in high season and longer-term renters in the winter months. Part of its attraction is the huge long beach that can be reached on foot, and its charming selection of Portuguese restaurants and café bars. In the summer months, there are activities at the beach as well as market stalls and open-air entertainments in the evening, but out of season, Manta Rota is a sleepy hollow! There is a good choice of restaurants, all of which can be recommended, and which vary in style of cuisine and price. The village is compact and has within easy reach a supermarket, butchers, bakers, and newsagent. Overall, it’s fair to say that there is not much else in Manta Rota – which probably the reason why people who holiday there love it – ‘simplicity is divinity’! – Manta Rota is the ideal place to experience a typical Portuguese holiday, with only the beach for company during the day. Vila Nova Cacela is around 1km from Manta Rota and has more shops and restaurants to offer."

    text: "The beach of Manta Rota is the sun worshipper’s paradise with white expansive sands and good water for swimming. Located at the bottom end of the village, the beach can be reached in easily on foot or by car. There is no need to take a boat ride as it is here that the lagoon of the Ria Formosa finally comes to an end! The car park can get quite busy in high season though. The beach offers amenities including sunbeds, shade, and some water sports in high season. There are also a couple of excellent fish restaurants to try. For those who enjoy walking, the coastline is long and easy to navigate with the neighboring resorts of Praia Verde and Monte Gordo all within around 30 minutes walk."
