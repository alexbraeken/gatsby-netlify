    text: "The grandly named country village of Santa Caterina da Fonte do Bispo sits in the rolling foothills of the Serra da Caldeirão, mid-distance between Tavira and São Brás de Alportel and only some 15km from the golden beaches at Fuzeta. Basic amenities including a well-stocked mini-market and a tempting café/bakery can be found at the heart of the village, home also the famed kilns producing Santa Caterina terracotta tiles, many of which adorn terraces and swimming pool surrounds across the Algarve.
    \n
    \nCuisine: Traditional flavoursome country dishes can be enjoyed at a handful of local eateries while a greater selection are but a short drive in any direction!"
