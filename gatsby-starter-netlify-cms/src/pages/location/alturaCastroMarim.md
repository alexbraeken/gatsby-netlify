    text: "Altura is a wonderful village which has retained most of its original Portuguese charm and character. During the day, there is a laid back, relaxed atmosphere where visitors can enjoy a coffee or a beer at one of the many small bars, or take a stroll and do some leisurely shopping. The village has a daily market selling fresh produce, patisseries, a mini-market, gift shops, and a bank, and there is also a large supermarket just towards the main road. In the evening, visitors can choose from a wide selection of restaurants to suit all tastes ranging from the cheap and cheerful Tascas to High-Quality cuisine. Overall, Altura is a lovely village, perfect for families and couples seeking to experience and enjoy a simple Portuguese beach holiday."

    text: "The beach of Altura (Alagoa) is the sun worshipperâ€™s paradise with white expansive sands and good water for swimming. Located at the bottom end of the village, the beach can be reached in easily on foot or by car. The car park can get quite busy in high season though. The beach offers amenities including sunbeds, shade, and some water sports in high season. There are also a couple of excellent fish restaurants to try. For those who enjoy walking, the coastline is long and easy to navigate with the neighboring resorts of Praia Verde and Monte Gordo all within around 30 minutes walk.
    
    Cabeco Beach is directly next door - The entrance is a bit hidden away and consequently, access isn't as busy. There is another great restaurant here where you can dine right on the edge of the ocean

Praia Verde - The entrance to Praia Verde beach is from above - you will need a car and be prepared to walk down the steps to reach the sands. Its name (translated as the 'Green Beach') is derived from the fact that it is unusually bordered by a lovely crest of pine trees, which makes the setting private. Gorgeous sands and a couple of lovely restaurants to try here. For the sun worshippers, there are sunbeds for hire and for those who enjoy walking, the beach is long and flat and its around 30 minutes on foot to Monte Gordo and Altura."

    header: "Castro Marim"
    text: "Castro Marim is an unspoiled location with a typical Eastern Algarve charm. The narrow streets are filled with character and have a choice of restaurants, bars, and cafes. The key feature of this town is the Castle which is open to the public and is at least worth a visit to sample the fabulous views which stretch right across Spain and the Guadiana River. If you happen to be visiting at the end of August, for 4 days each year, Castro Marim takes a leap back into the past for its Medieval Days festival. Enter the castle and you enter another, older world. A truly fantastic and different experience."
