    text: "Fuseta is a small town situated right in the heart of the Ria Formosa, generally only busy in the main summer months. Fishing boats leave from one end of the quay, small pleasure boats and the ferry to the island from the other. Fuseta has a street market on Thursdays and a flea market on the first Sunday of every month. There is a newly renovated produce market situated on the quayside which is open every morning (not Sundays) where you can buy fresh fish, meat, fruit, and vegetables. On Saturdays, the market is surrounded outside by many smaller stalls offering further local produce. Definitely a very unspoiled traditional Portuguese atmosphere along with 2 beaches to choose from!"

    text: "The first beach is a small beach on the lagoon in the town itself which is very busy in the morning and late afternoon in August and can be reached on foot. There are sunbeds and other amenities and its also ideal families with young children as the waters are calm and shallow. The second beach is just across the lagoon on Ilha de Armona, reached only by taking the boat ride from the harbor and is extremely popular in high season. The beach extends left and right for miles, so those seeking some more peace and privacy can walk for five, ten, twenty minutes or more and find as much beach to themselves as they like. A really lovely experience and highly recommended for beach lovers."
