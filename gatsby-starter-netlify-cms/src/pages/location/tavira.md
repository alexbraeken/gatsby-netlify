    text: "Tavira lies at the centre of the Eastern Algarve coast and is a most picturesque town. Once known as the capital of the Algarve, it stands proud amongst Portuguese history books and you will not fail to be enthralled by its unspoiled charm, character, and tranquility. As you wander along the cobbled streets, you'll see an abundance of history. A Roman bridge links the 2 parts of the town across the River Gilao, its sides decorated with traditional old bars and restaurants where visitors can get busy doing nothing simply watching the world go by and the fish that jump in the river! For those who enjoy sightseeing, there are so many churches (37 in total!) to view, along with the town castle, several monuments and above all, a visit to the ‘Camara Obscura’ is not only highly recommended but absolutely fascinating and uses an optical instrument to offer a 360° panoramic-view of the town which is the perfect way to capture the essence of Tavira Otherwise, you can take a tour of the whole town in a miniature 'train' or a beautiful horse-drawn carriage. Diners have a huge choice of restaurants, many specializing in seafood and those who enjoy cooking at home should head for the fantastic municipal market where a wealth of fresh food is on offer each morning: fish, seafood, meat, deli, fruit, and vegetables - much of it caught, reared, killed, made, grown and picked locally. During the high season, there are open-air festivals and evening events with dancing, music and other local shows which everyone is welcome to enjoy. Tavira is a lovely family orientated town, with a charming ambiance and a wonderful, ‘laid back’ atmosphere, and certainly has something for everyone."

    text: "Tavira Island (Ilha de Tavira) A great beach for a full day out. The island has a good selection of restaurants and beach bars all centered around its campsite, but if you are looking for a more peaceful spot, the sands are long and expansive, so a short walk will take you away from the hustle and bustle to more peaceful plains. The sands are separated from the mainland by the River Formosa, so it’s necessary to take a short boat ride across. In high season, you can catch the big ferry from the center of Tavira which leaves from the fishing harbor between the old market and the big road bridge and takes around 15 minutes. At any time of year, you can catch the little ferry from the quay at Quatro Águas which is about two kilometers from the main town (you could take the tourist train to QuatroAguas) and is then a short 5-minute ride across the lagoon to the beach. An excellent range of facilities are on offer, including beach bars, fish restaurants, Tavira Island, together with its excellent choice of amenities, rolling Atlantic Ocean and white sandy beaches provides a wonderful tropical holiday atmosphere you could liken to the Caribbean!

 
Barril Beach is one of the most popular with children because of the miniature train journey to reach it. The train ends at the old tuna station which has now been converted into cafés, restaurants, toilets and other facilities for tourists. You will see other bits of the station building near one of the old wooden boats in a 'graveyard' of huge iron anchors protruding from the dunes once used to secure the massive tuna net to the sea bed. The beach is very busy at the main entrance but is wide and expansive so within a few minutes walk the crowds are less dense. Towards the left, you will come to the only official nudist beach in the Eastern Algarve."
