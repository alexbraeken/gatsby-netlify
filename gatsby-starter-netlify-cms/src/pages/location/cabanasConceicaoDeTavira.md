    text: "Sitting by the coast a few kilometres east of Tavira, Cabanas was once a traditional Algarvian fishing village with a mix of cobbled back streets and an unfussy waterfront of low-rise buildings looking out across the still lagoon to Cabanas Island. With the age of tourism, Cabanas and its inland neighbour, Conceição, have grown yet retain much of their charm. Attracted by fabulous beaches and a varied selection of cafes, bars and restaurants, both have become popular with Portuguese and foreign visitors alike. The village can be leisurely strolled from end to end in around 30 minutes and offers an excellent choice of restaurants, bars and cafes catering for all palettes - most of which are along the sea front capturing the daytime sunshine. For smaller budgets and a taste of the real Algarve, there are also several traditional bars and Tascas serving typical Portuguese meals in the back streets at very reasonable prices! The village has 2 well stocked supermarkets, and there is a daily fresh food market on the main river front, as well as butcheries and bakeries. Cabanas is not a destination for those seeking activity and night life - the atmosphere is generally relaxed and perfect for socialising, relaxing and dining.
    \n
    \nCuisine: Along the waterfront and dotted about the narrow streets, various restaurants and local eateries provide for all tastes and pockets, with some locally renown establishments always busy – so be sure to book ahead!

    \n Conceicao, as a suburb of Tavira and Cabans has a friendly feel and offers its visitors a warm welcome. Here you will find here a pleasant selection of café bars where you can sit in the sun and enjoy a refreshment or 2(!) along with 3 restaurants offering good quality Portuguese cuisine. The village also has a post office, cash machine and a mini market"

    text: "Separated by an arm of the River Formosa the beach sands are reached via a short and inexpensive boat crossing, where you will find mile upon mile of dune backed golden sands lapped by the crystal blue waters of the Atlantic Ocean; a paradise just waiting to be explored and enjoyed."
