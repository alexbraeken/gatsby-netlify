    header: "A Popular and Compact Family Beach Town…"
    text: "Sitting between Cabanas and Altura, Manta Rota offers a family atmosphere within a low rise, uncommercialised setting. Tremendous expansive golden sands, backed by impressive dunes, have deservedly been awarded the Blue Flag accolade, while an ample sprinkling of cafes, bars, restaurants and mini-markets provide for all needs. With all this on offer, it’s easy to see why Manta Rota is a firm favourite for the Portuguese, who surely know a thing or two about great beach destinations! In the summer months, there are activities at the beach as well as market stalls and open-air entertainments in the evening, whilst out of season, Manta Rota is a charming and laid-back destination! Manta Rota is the ideal place to experience a typical Portuguese holiday, with only the beach for company during the day.
    \n
    \nCuisine: From traditional to modern and from low cost to premium, all tastes and pockets are catered for with fresh flavoursome seafood being the star attraction on many a menu."
