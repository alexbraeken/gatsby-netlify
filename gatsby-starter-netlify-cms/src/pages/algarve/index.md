description: "Human presence on the Algarve dates to Neolithic times, with the region being witness to various visitors ever since including Phoenicians, Carthaginians and Romans, Visigoths and the Moors who ruled for over 500 years from 711. During this time, the region was known as ‘Al Gharb’. It was not until the 13th Century that the Moors relinquished control to the Kingdom of Portugal and from 1471, King Afonso III, reigned as ‘King of Portugal and the Algarve’. This separateness from the rest of Portugal remained for many centuries with the region being a semi-autonomous area."
sliderText: "In the 15th Century, Prince Henry the Navigator based himself near Lagos, directing various maritime expeditions which established Portugal as a major power during the era of the ‘Voyages of Discovery’. Lagos became the region’s capital and it was not until 1756, the year after the great Lisbon earthquake, that Lagos lost its seat of power. The earthquake and the accompanying tsunami damaged and destroyed much of the coastal region except for Faro which was protected by the sandy banks and islands of the Ria Formosa lagoon, now a natural park.

During the Napoleonic wars, Spanish troops occupied the Algarve in 1807 but were driven out the following year and after the establishment of the first Republic in 1910, the Kingdom of Portugal and the Algarve ceased to exist, with the Algarve being fully incorporated into the Portuguese Republic.

From the 1960s, the region became a popular destination for holidaymakers attracted by an excellent year-round climate (over 3000 hours of sunshine annually with virtually no rain during summer months), relatively low prices and of course what are now regarded as some of the finest beaches in Europe. To this day, the region remains one of the most popular summer destinations for both the Portuguese and European markets and now also attracts a growing number of foreigners who have settled permanently."

conclusion: "The coast with its various towns and cities is where much of the 450,000 inhabitants live and work, either in traditional industries such as fishing and agriculture, or service industries - the main sector being tourism. The cosmopolitan towns of Faro, Lagos, and Portimão act as administration and shopping hubs and provide a distinct contrast to the slower rhythm of life in the hills. The resorts of Vale do Lobo, Quinta do Lago, Albufeira, Vilamoura and others have become established holiday destinations known on a national and international level. The sleepier towns of Tavira, Silves, and São Bras de Alportel provide a reminder of the past with their cobbled streets, historical architecture and relaxed atmosphere. To the east, the coast is flat and bordered in part by the large expanse of sandbanks, lagoons, and islands which form the beautiful Ria Formosa natural park, home to a myriad of waterfowl and marine life. To the west, the coast is more dramatic with cliffs, caves and little bays providing scenic backdrops and picturesque beaches and ending with the towering cliffs of Cape St. Vincent, a windswept land once thought to be the end of the World. Heading north along the ‘Costa Vicentina’, the Atlantic breakers create dramatic seascapes bringing Europe’s finest surfers to ply their skills over the waves.

The Algarve has much to offer the visitor from sun-drenched beaches, excellent cuisine, friendly people, a slower pace of life and stunning landscapes. We hope that you enjoy your experience and wish to return again and again to sample the many delights of the Algarve."
