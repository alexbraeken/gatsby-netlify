        Human presence on the Algarve dates to Neolithic times, with the region being witness to various visitors ever since including Phoenicians, Carthaginians and Romans, Visigoths and the Moors who ruled for over 500 years from 711. During this time, the region was known as ‘Al Gharb’. It was not until the 13th Century that the Moors relinquished control to the Kingdom of Portugal and from 1471, King Afonso III, reigned as ‘King of Portugal and the Algarve’. This separateness from the rest of Portugal remained for many centuries with the region being a semi-autonomous area.
