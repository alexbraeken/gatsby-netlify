<h2 style="text-align:center">WHO MIGHT VISIT THE PROPERTY ?</h2>
</div>

<p>All our properties are maintained by the staff who have access to the pool/garden area if your property is set in private grounds.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Gardens – usually maintained once per week</li>
	<li>Pools – usually maintained once per week and twice per week in high season.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We ask for your cooperation when our pool or garden operatives visit, as it is imperative to keep the properties well maintained for our clients' enjoyment throughout the year.</p>

<p>Visits from the Maintenance team – these will usually be at your request if something has gone wrong or needs fixing. However, the maintenance team will only enter your property with your prior approval or by request.</p>

<p>All Smartavillas operatives carry company ID and will be happy to show on request.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center">PERSONAL HEALTH</h2>
</div>

<p><strong>Ensure that you are covered for any illness or accidents</strong> - Private treatment is expensive. You are therefore strongly advised to take out comprehensive travel and medical insurance before travelling. You should check any exclusions, and that your policy covers you for the activities you might want to undertake. If you have an emergency and need an ambulance, the number is 112.</p>

<p>Please note that the address of your rental property is situated on a laminated sheet on an internal wall by the front door. It is a good idea to take note of this address in case you need to give it to the emergency services (or even a taxi driver!). Taking a photo of the address sheet on your phone is one way of keeping the address to hand.</p>

<p><strong>Sunbathing</strong> - The sun in Portugal is very strong. Even with cloud cover rays can still harm unprotected skin and we strongly advise a sun cream with a high Sun Protection Factor to avoid burns.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div style="width: 100%; background-color:#ff6600;">
<h2 style="text-align:center">SAFETY…. INSIDE THE PROPERTY</h2>
</div>

<p><strong>Familiarize yourself with your holiday home </strong>– we ask that you are conscious of health and safety hazards whilst during your stay and familiarize yourself with all aspects of your accommodation upon arrival. Particular note should be made of pool depths and slippery pool patio tiles, light switches, oven and hob controls and electrical sockets etc. Please note that you will require continental, 2 pin plug adaptors for electrical sockets/appliances. All of our rental properties are regularly checked and maintained; however, you should raise any concerns you have directly with us.</p>

<p><strong>Please don’t try to fix anything on your own</strong> - no matter how DIY savvy you are. If you notice anything broken or hazardous please inform the Smartavilllas office.</p>

<p><strong>Floor Tiles or Marble Floors</strong> - can be very slippery when wet, particularly the tiles around the poolside. Please take extra care and walk (not run!) around the poolside.</p>

<p><strong>Steps and Stairs</strong> - Many of our properties have steps, either inside or out in the property grounds. These can be steep and might become slippery if it’s damp or raining. Please do take care while you are moving about, and make sure that your feet (and the kids’ feet!) are properly dry after swimming or bathing.</p>

<p><strong>Gas Safety</strong> - Some of our properties have gas appliances. If you have any concerns about them or think that there might be a problem then do not turn on or off any light switches, do not use torches, or use any open flames such as candles or lighters. Immediately if safe to do so, open all the doors and windows, then leave the properly and contact us immediately.</p>

<p><strong>Fire Safety </strong>– on arrival we will show you where the fire extinguishers and fire blankets are. Please make a note of their locations. If the smoke detector starts to bleep, please let us know so we can arrange to replace the batteries. In the event of a fire, please leave the property immediately and call the Smartavillas office and 112 for emergency services.</p>

<p><strong>First Aid Kit </strong>– all our properties are equipped with a general first aid kit and its location is marked. If you have cause to use the first aid kit and are unable to replace what you use, we would appreciate you advising us so that we can ensure it is complete for the next occupants</p>

<p><strong>Smoking</strong> – is not permitted inside any of our properties. And smoking outside also presents a risk if you are in the countryside. Please ensure if smoking outside that all cigarette stubs and ashtrays are disposed of safely. Portugal has a high risk of fires, especially in the rural villa zones.</p>

<p><strong>Tap Water</strong> - The tap water in many overseas destinations has a higher mineral content than you may be used to, so it may be salty to taste and might upset your stomach. For this reason, you may wish to drink bottled water. To avoid dehydration, please remember to drink plenty of water when it’s hot.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div style="width: 100%; background-color:#ff6600;">
<h2 style="text-align:center">SAFETY…. OUTSIDE THE PROPERTY</h2>
</div>

<p><strong>Swimming Pools </strong>– are dangerous if not treated with respect:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Please supervise your children at all times</li>
	<li>Please do not take glasses, crockery or breakable property to the pool area</li>
	<li>Ensure that you know where the life buoy is located</li>
	<li>Familiarize yourself with the pool depths</li>
	<li>Please shower before swimming - excessive sunscreen can affect the ph. and the quality of the water</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Balconies and Roof Terraces</strong> -These are not play areas, please ensure that children are not left unsupervised in parts pf the property that may be dangerous to them.</p>

<p><strong>BBQ </strong>– Of course everyone loves an open-air BBQ, but please ensure that its used with due care and that embers are sufficiently extinguished after use to avoid the risk of fires.</p>

<p><strong>Insects/animals</strong> - Mosquitoes, ants, cockroaches, wasps and other insects are common in warmer climates, particularly in rural locations. Ant powders are a good repellents, but it also helps to keep crumbs to a minimum, keep food in suitable containers, and regularly remove rubbish from your property to keep them under control. Mosquitoes can be kept at bay by a good repellent, which can be purchased in before you arrive in your own country or in local chemists and supermarkets. Many of our properties are surrounded by gardens and countryside and field mice, other rodents, native reptiles and arachnids are also common, along with local farm animals. Local dogs and cats sometimes roam around unattended or are kept in kennels or on land surrounding your property and may cause a disturbance. Please do not encourage stray animals by feeding them.</p>

<p><strong>Rubbish/ Refuse </strong>– please ensure that you regularly dispose of waste, rubbish and recycling items from the property. These should be placed in the nearby pedal bins or recycling points found in local streets and kerbsides, and not left inside the property, or on the grounds of the property</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div style="width: 100%; background-color:#ff6600;">
<h2 style="text-align:center">OUT AND ABOUT</h2>
</div>

<p><strong>Beach Safety</strong> – Everyone loves going to the beach, but even the safest beach can be dangerous in certain weather conditions. Please observe these simple rules:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Review the beach signage and check for warning flags – ask what they mean if you need to or are unsure</li>
	<li>Never swim where a sign says not to</li>
	<li>Be aware of tides and currents</li>
	<li>Closely supervise your children – don’t let them swim alone</li>
	<li>Do not use inflatables in the ocean</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>In the Town </strong>- Try not to carry more money that you need. If you do need to carry a large amount of cash, it’s a good idea to split it with a friend or your partner.</p>

<p><strong>Crossing the Road</strong> – You should also be aware that in some countries traffic is not required to stop at pedestrian crossings, so please take care before crossing.</p>

<p><strong>Driving </strong>- Always wear a seat belt, and when hiring a car be sure to carry emergency/breakdown telephone numbers. The car hire documents should also be with you in the car.</p>

<p><strong>Driving License and photo ID</strong> – should be carried with you at all times. Police can ask to see it at any time, and it is an offence not to carry it with you.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div style="width: 100%; background-color:#ff6600;">
<h2 style="text-align:center">SECURITY</h2>
</div>

<p><strong>Travel Insurance </strong>– Please ensure that you have adequate travel insurance as it is essential to cover your personal belongings. In the event that you should lose any items of value whilst on holiday through theft or otherwise, you must report the facts immediately to the local police or other competent authority and obtain a written report. If a report is not obtained it will be difficult for you to pursue any claim through your holiday insurance.</p>

<p><strong>All personal items</strong> - retained at the accommodation are done so at your own risk. There are differing elements of locks, keys and security measures at each property, details of which will be explained on arrival.</p>

<p><strong>Keys</strong> - Each of our properties has a minimum of 2 sets of keys. Extra care should be taken to not forget your keys when you go out or leave the keys in the back of the lock. Locksmiths are very expensive here in the Algarve!</p>

<p><strong>Windows and Shutters</strong> – we recommend that you ensure everything is locked when you leave. Not only does it ensure security, it keeps the property cool in the height of summer.</p>
