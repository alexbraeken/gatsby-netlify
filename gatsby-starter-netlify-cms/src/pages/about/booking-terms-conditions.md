								<h1 style="text-align:center"><strong>BOOKING CONDITIONS &amp; GUEST INFORMATION</strong></h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;Smartavillas Unipessoal Lda (hereafter referred to as Smartavillas)</strong> is a Portuguese Registered property management company acting on behalf of the property owner. The Agreement to rent is made between the guest and the property owner.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><span style="color:#FFFFFF"><span style="background-color:#ff6600"><strong>1. BOOKING CONDITIONS</strong></span></span></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In making a booking, the first named person on the booking information agrees on behalf of all persons within the booking party that:</p>

<p>· He/she has read these terms and conditions and has the authority of all persons within the booking party to act on their behalf and agrees to be bound by them.</p>

<p>· He/she accepts financial responsibility for payment of the booking on behalf of all persons detailed on the booking</p>

<p>· He/she consents to our use of their information in accordance with our Privacy Notice and in accordance with local laws</p>

<p>· These Booking Conditions and any agreement to which they apply are governed in all respects by Portuguese law. We both agree that any dispute, claim or other matter which arises between us out of or in connection with your contract or booking will be dealt with by Binding Arbitration under Portuguese Law.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>a) <strong>Guest Occupancy</strong> - The Accommodation is reserved exclusively for guests named within the booking only and should not exceed maximum occupancy without prior agreement. Over occupancy without good reason and express permission will result in penalty charges and be in contravention of local legislation.</p>

<p>b) <strong>On Departure</strong> - The accommodation should be left in an acceptable condition to enable it to be sufficiently prepared for the next guests. This includes proper disposal of waste and rubbish items which should be disposed of in the nearby containers or recycling points, and not left inside the property or within the grounds of the property. We also ask that the BBQ is left in a good condition without wasted charcoal or food debris, as this will attract vermin.</p>

<p>c) <strong>SEF Reporting</strong> - By law, we must report all non-Portuguese citizens that stay in Portuguese rental accommodation to <strong>SEF</strong> (Serviço de Estrangeiros e Fronteiras). It is therefore imperative that we have all passport details. We will ask for these details <u><strong>at the time of booking</strong></u>, to complete the reservation. If any guests’ passports are unavailable as they are being renewed, please be aware that they will be required and need to be supplied as soon as possible and certainly no later than your arrival at the accommodation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><span style="color:#FFFFFF"><span style="background-color:#ff6600">2. RENTAL PRICES AND ADDITIONAL FEES</span></span></h2>

<p>Of course, we do understand that flight timetables and travel plans do not always fall in line with this schedule and will do everything possible to assist with earlier arrival and later departure times. For instance, if you are arriving early, we may be able to arrange a bag drop whilst we complete the rental property preparations. In the case of later departures, we will do our best to assist with either a late checkout or luggage storage and recommendations of nearby facilities, which may incur a charge.</p>

<p><strong>b) Late Arrivals:</strong></p>

<p>In some of our properties, key safe boxes are installed. In this instance, if you are arriving late, we will supply you with the key safe code in advance and then arrange a courtesy visit for the following day. If the property does not have the key safe facility and we need to meet you with the keys, please remember that there will be a charge for the late check in- payable on arrival to the representative, as detailed in the relevant table in Section 2, point (f).</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#FFFFFF">PAYMENT PLANS AND CANCELLATION TERMS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At Smartavillas, we like to operate flexible policies to meet the needs of the customer, therefore you may choose payment terms that best suit your needs from one of several options as listed below.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Guest Cancellation Charges</strong> - If you need to cancel your holiday, cancellation takes effect on the date we receive your email notification. If you cancel after we confirm your booking, the booking fee will still be applied as we incur costs from the moment you make the booking, and an additional administration fee of 50€ will also be applied. The closer your cancellation is to your due date of arrival in Portugal, the less likely we are to recover the costs by re-selling the property rental at the original price. Our cancellation charges therefore increase as the arrival date approaches. The cancellation charges detailed below are calculated on the basis of the total cost of the booking. The scale of charges will vary according to the chose payment plan.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Changes by the Booking Party</strong> - Any requests for changes to an existing booking must be notified in writing by the person making the booking. We will of course do our utmost to accommodate the request but cannot make any firm guarantees. AN administration charge of 25€ will be applied. Such circumstances may be as outlined below, subject to the following terms and charges:</p>
