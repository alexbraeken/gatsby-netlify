### COVID-19 EMERGENCY GUIDELINES - CANCELLATION AND DEFERMENT (Last Update: 7 June 2020)​

 

We realise that there are restrictions and uncertainties around travel arrangements. The Smartavillas team respects your welfare and aims to assist where possible. If you are prevented from travelling to Portugal because of a country lock-down or travel suspension, we advise you to contact your travel insurance provider in the first instance.

 

The Smartavillas Cancellation Policy is determined by the National Portuguese Government Law:

 

### (Decree Law n.º 17/2020 of 23 April 2020)

 

The law states that you are eligible to receive a travel voucher of equal value to the payment made. This will allow you to defer and change the dates of your booking

 

The conditions are as follows:

The travel voucher must be used by 31 December 2021
Any monies paid to date will be held and carried over without penalty to any new booking made
Any deferred dates would be subject to availability and possible additional costs for a different seasonal rate.
If travel to Portugal is possible but you are feeling unsure about making the journey, you may contact us to request a cancellation, the % refund of which will be applied to either the partial deposit payment or the full balance payment as below, and which is in line with our standard terms of cancellation.
