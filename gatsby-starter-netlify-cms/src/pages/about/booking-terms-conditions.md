								<h1 style="text-align:center"><strong>BOOKING CONDITIONS &amp; GUEST INFORMATION</strong></h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;Smartavillas Unipessoal Lda (hereafter referred to as Smartavillas)</strong> is a Portuguese Registered property management company acting on behalf of the property owner. The Agreement to rent is made between the guest and the property owner.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><span style="color:#FFFFFF"><span style="background-color:#ff6600"><strong>1. BOOKING CONDITIONS</strong></span></span></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In making a booking, the first named person on the booking information agrees on behalf of all persons within the booking party that:</p>

<p>· A contract between you and the property owner will come into existence when payment is received and will be deemed as of acceptance of these Terms and Conditions. The contract binds you & all the members of your party and It is your responsibility to ensure that all members of your party accept the prescribed terms. Failure to disclose all relevant information or comply with these terms may lead to termination of the contract & loss of the booking.</p>

<p>· Bookings cannot be accepted from persons under eighteen years of age.</p>

<p>· You consent to our use of your information in accordance with our Privacy Notice and in accordance with local laws.</p>

<p>· These Booking Conditions and any agreement to which they apply are governed in all respects by Portuguese law. We both agree that any dispute, claim or other matter which arises between us out of or in connection with your contract or booking will be dealt with by Binding Arbitration under Portuguese Law.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>a) <strong>Guest Occupancy</strong> - No parties or events – the maximum number of persons using the accommodation at any time must not exceed the maximum occupancy and only those listed on the booking form can occupy the property. We reserve the right to terminate the booking without notice and without refund in case of a breach of this condition.</p>

<p>b) <strong>Smoking</strong> - Smoking or vaping anywhere inside the premises is not permitted and could result termination of occupancy and forfeiture of all Security Deposits. This must be strictly adhered to and any damage or extra cleaning caused by smoking will be at your own expense.</p>

<p>c) Pets (if not allowed) brought to and staying inside the premises will result in immediate termination of occupancy and forfeiture of all payments. This must be strictly adhered to and any damage or extra cleaning caused by pets or smoking will be at your own expense. For properties allowing pets, an additional fee will be charged.
</p>

<p>d) <strong>On Departure</strong> - The accommodation should be left in an acceptable condition to enable it to be sufficiently prepared for the next guests. This includes proper disposal of waste and rubbish items which should be disposed of in the nearby containers or recycling points, and not left inside the property or within the grounds of the property. We also ask that the BBQ is left in a good condition without wasted charcoal or food debris, as this will attract vermin. The property owner reserves the right to make a charge to cover additional cleaning costs if the client leaves the property in an unacceptable condition. Please note that if any keys issued are not returned at the end of your stay, then the cost of replacement will be charged to you.
</p>

<p>e) <strong>SEF Reporting</strong> - By law, we must report all non-Portuguese citizens that stay in Portuguese rental accommodation to <strong>SEF</strong> (Serviço de Estrangeiros e Fronteiras). It is therefore imperative that we have all passport details. We will ask for these details <u><strong>at the time of booking</strong></u>, to complete the reservation. If any guests’ passports are unavailable as they are being renewed, please be aware that they will be required and need to be supplied as soon as possible and certainly no later than your arrival at the accommodation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><span style="color:#FFFFFF"><span style="background-color:#ff6600">2. RENTAL PRICES AND ADDITIONAL FEES</span></span></h2>

<p>As you will appreciate, sufficient time needs to be given to cleaning and preparing the accommodation for your stay, as well as the incoming guests. We guarantee that accommodation will be available after 4pm (16.00h) on the day of arrival and request that it is vacated by 10am (10.00h) on the day of departure.</p>

<p>Of course, we do understand that flight timetables and travel plans do not always fall in line with this schedule and will do everything possible to assist with earlier arrival and later departure times. For instance, if you are arriving early, we may be able to arrange a bag drop whilst we complete the rental property preparations. In the case of later departures, we will do our best to assist with either a late checkout or luggage storage and recommendations of nearby facilities, which may incur a charge.</p>

<p><strong>b) Late Arrivals:</strong></p>

<p>In some of our properties, key safe boxes are installed. In this instance, if you are arriving late, we will supply you with the key safe code in advance and then arrange a courtesy visit for the following day. If the property does not have the key safe facility and we need to meet you with the keys, please remember that there will be a charge for the late check in- payable on arrival to the representative, as detailed in the relevant table in Section 2, point (f).</p>

<p>1. The 30% booking deposit is non-refundable.</p>
<p>2. If a cancellation is necessary less than 14 days before arrival, and where the full balance has been paid, regrettably no refund will be possible.</p>
<p>3. However, if as a result of the global pandemic, you are prevented from travelling to Portugal then the COVID-19 Deferment Policy will apply.

<h2>COVID-19 DEFERMENT POLICY</h2>
<hr />
<p>We realise that there are presently restrictions and uncertainties around travel arrangements. The Smartavillas team respects your welfare and aims to assist where possible. If you are prevented from travelling to Portugal because of a government advice such as a country lock-down or travel suspension, we advise you to contact your travel insurance provider in the first instance.</p>

<p>We will offer a holiday rental voucher of equal value to the payment made. This will allow you to defer and change the dates of your booking.</p>

<p>The conditions are as follows:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
	<li>The travel voucher must be used by 31 December 2022.</li>
	<li>Any monies paid to date will be held and transferred to the value of the new booking.</li>
	<li>Any deferred dates would be subject to availability and possible additional costs for a different seasonal rate.</li>
	<li>An amendment fee of 25€ will be applied.</li>
</ol>
