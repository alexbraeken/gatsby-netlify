quote: "Rachel and Smartavillas have been our villa letting and management agent for 15 years now – from the very beginning when we were finding our way with the rentals process and all that it entails.  We have stayed with Rachel for this time because of her professionalism and personal touch – Rachel very much take a ‘work with us’ approach – and delivery not only high level of customer service to their clients, but also to us as villa owners.  Rachel understands its very important to us to know our property is in safe, good hands and we want our clients to be delighted with their stay –from start to finish - and come back.  Our feedback from clients in all this time, season after season, has always been positive and where problems have arisen they have been dealt with professionally and with quickly.  Communication is so important in this business and Rachel understands this fully.  We fully recommend SV – we certainly intend to stay with SV for the foreseeable future.  A great team!"
