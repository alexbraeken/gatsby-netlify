    When our apartment manager decided to retire in 2014 it was a stressful time trying to find a replacement. Thankfully we found Smartavillas where Rachel and her team have become like our extended family in Tavira. They are always on hand no matter what, to solve any problems we may have with our property from minor things like ant attacks and lost keys to more major problems like leaks causing dampness. If they can't solve the problem within their own team they will source trades people who can.
    They provide a comprehensive service, meeting and greeting our renters, managing the cleaning and maintenance of the apartment and will take bookings on our behalf via their own website.
    Our renters appreciate their excellent service too and we regularly have very positive feedback such as 'the management team were great, Denise showed us the way to the apartment and we arrived earlier than usual as the apartment was ready for us which made for a relaxed start to our visit'  and 'Great welcome from the agent too'
    If you are looking for peace of mind and a reliable, enthusiastic, progressive team that are always striving to improve their business and yours then look no further.
