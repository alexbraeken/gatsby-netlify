quote: "We have used Smartavillas to look after our Property for approx ten years now and are very pleased with the professional manner in which Smartavillas deal with any problems or issues on our behalf.

The rental customers that Smartavillas provide for us are of the best quality and achieve higher bookings than our normal internet rental portals, and we can really leave everything to them.

Owning a property abroad means you will always have issues and things to sort, but the turnkey package provided by Smartavillas means “peace of mind” to us.

From the initial booking, house keeping, property care and maintenance and more recently Covid restrictions, everything is handled smoothly, professionally and with a smile."
