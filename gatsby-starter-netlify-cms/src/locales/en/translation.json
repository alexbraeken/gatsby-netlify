"Human presence on the Algarve dates to Neolithic times, with the region being witness to various visitors ever since including Phoenicians, Carthaginians and Romans, Visigoths and the Moors who ruled for over 500 years from 711. During this time, the region was known as ‘Al Gharb’. It was not until the 13th Century that the Moors relinquished control to the Kingdom of Portugal and from 1471, King Afonso III, reigned as ‘King of Portugal and the Algarve’. This separateness from the rest of Portugal remained for many centuries with the region being a semi-autonomous area.":"Human presence on the Algarve dates to Neolithic times, with the region being witness to various visitors ever since including Phoenicians, Carthaginians and Romans, Visigoths and the Moors who ruled for over 500 years from 711.

"In the 15th Century, Prince Henry the Navigator based himself near Lagos, directing various maritime expeditions which established Portugal as a major power during the era of the ‘Voyages of Discovery’. Lagos became the region’s capital and it was not until 1756, the year after the great Lisbon earthquake, that Lagos lost its seat of power. The earthquake and the accompanying tsunami damaged and destroyed much of the coastal region except for Faro which was protected by the sandy banks and islands of the Ria Formosa lagoon, now a natural park. During the Napoleonic wars, Spanish troops occupied the Algarve in 1807 but were driven out the following year and after the establishment of the first Republic in 1910, the Kingdom of Portugal and the Algarve ceased to exist, with the Algarve being fully incorporated into the Portuguese Republic. From the 1960s, the region became a popular destination for holidaymakers attracted by an excellent year-round climate (over 3000 hours of sunshine annually with virtually no rain during summer months), relatively low prices and of course what are now regarded as some of the finest beaches in Europe. To this day, the region remains one of the most popular summer destinations for both the Portuguese and European markets and now also attracts a growing number of foreigners who have settled permanently.":"In the 15th Century, Prince Henry the Navigator based himself near Lagos, directing various maritime expeditions which established Portugal as a major power during the era of the ‘Voyages of Discovery’.

"The coast with its various towns and cities is where much of the 450,000 inhabitants live and work, either in traditional industries such as fishing and agriculture, or service industries - the main sector being tourism. The cosmopolitan towns of Faro, Lagos, and Portimão act as administration and shopping hubs and provide a distinct contrast to the slower rhythm of life in the hills. The resorts of Vale do Lobo, Quinta do Lago, Albufeira, Vilamoura and others have become established holiday destinations known on a national and international level. The sleepier towns of Tavira, Silves, and São Bras de Alportel provide a reminder of the past with their cobbled streets, historical architecture and relaxed atmosphere. To the east, the coast is flat and bordered in part by the large expanse of sandbanks, lagoons, and islands which form the beautiful Ria Formosa natural park, home to a myriad of waterfowl and marine life. To the west, the coast is more dramatic with cliffs, caves and little bays providing scenic backdrops and picturesque beaches and ending with the towering cliffs of Cape St. Vincent, a windswept land once thought to be the end of the World. Heading north along the ‘Costa Vicentina’, the Atlantic breakers create dramatic seascapes bringing Europe’s finest surfers to ply their skills over the waves. The Algarve has much to offer the visitor from sun-drenched beaches, excellent cuisine, friendly people, a slower pace of life and stunning landscapes. We hope that you enjoy your experience and wish to return again and again to sample the many delights of the Algarve.":"The coast with its various towns and cities is where much of the 450,000 inhabitants live and work, either in traditional industries such as fishing and agriculture, or service industries - the main sector being tourism.

"Tavira lies at the centre of the Eastern Algarve coast and is a most picturesque town. Once known as the capital of the Algarve, it stands proud amongst Portuguese history books and you will not fail to be enthralled by its unspoiled charm, character, and tranquility. As you wander along the cobbled streets, you'll see an abundance of history. A Roman bridge links the 2 parts of the town across the River Gilao, its sides decorated with traditional old bars and restaurants where visitors can get busy doing nothing simply watching the world go by and the fish that jump in the river! For those who enjoy sightseeing, there are so many churches (37 in total!) to view, along with the town castle, several monuments and above all, a visit to the ‘Camara Obscura’ is not only highly recommended but absolutely fascinating and uses an optical instrument to offer a 360° panoramic-view of the town which is the perfect way to capture the essence of Tavira Otherwise, you can take a tour of the whole town in a miniature 'train' or a beautiful horse-drawn carriage. Diners have a huge choice of restaurants, many specializing in seafood and those who enjoy cooking at home should head for the fantastic municipal market where a wealth of fresh food is on offer each morning: fish, seafood, meat, deli, fruit, and vegetables - much of it caught, reared, killed, made, grown and picked locally. During the high season, there are open-air festivals and evening events with dancing, music and other local shows which everyone is welcome to enjoy. Tavira is a lovely family orientated town, with a charming ambiance and a wonderful, ‘laid back’ atmosphere, and certainly has something for everyone.":"Tavira lies at the centre of the Eastern Algarve coast and is a most picturesque town.

"Tavira Island (Ilha de Tavira) A great beach for a full day out. The island has a good selection of restaurants and beach bars all centered around its campsite, but if you are looking for a more peaceful spot, the sands are long and expansive, so a short walk will take you away from the hustle and bustle to more peaceful plains. The sands are separated from the mainland by the River Formosa, so it’s necessary to take a short boat ride across. In high season, you can catch the big ferry from the center of Tavira which leaves from the fishing harbor between the old market and the big road bridge and takes around 15 minutes. At any time of year, you can catch the little ferry from the quay at Quatro Águas which is about two kilometers from the main town (you could take the tourist train to QuatroAguas) and is then a short 5-minute ride across the lagoon to the beach. An excellent range of facilities are on offer, including beach bars, fish restaurants, Tavira Island, together with its excellent choice of amenities, rolling Atlantic Ocean and white sandy beaches provides a wonderful tropical holiday atmosphere you could liken to the Caribbean! Barril Beach is one of the most popular with children because of the miniature train journey to reach it. The train ends at the old tuna station which has now been converted into cafés, restaurants, toilets and other facilities for tourists. You will see other bits of the station building near one of the old wooden boats in a 'graveyard' of huge iron anchors protruding from the dunes once used to secure the massive tuna net to the sea bed. The beach is very busy at the main entrance but is wide and expansive so within a few minutes walk the crowds are less dense. Towards the left, you will come to the only official nudist beach in the Eastern Algarve.":"Tavira Island (Ilha de Tavira) A great beach for a full day out.

"Altura":"Altura",
"Altura is a wonderful village which has retained most of its original Portuguese charm and character. During the day, there is a laid back, relaxed atmosphere where visitors can enjoy a coffee or a beer at one of the many small bars, or take a stroll and do some leisurely shopping. The village has a daily market selling fresh produce, patisseries, a mini-market, gift shops, and a bank, and there is also a large supermarket just towards the main road. In the evening, visitors can choose from a wide selection of restaurants to suit all tastes ranging from the cheap and cheerful Tascas to High-Quality cuisine. Overall, Altura is a lovely village, perfect for families and couples seeking to experience and enjoy a simple Portuguese beach holiday.":"Altura is a wonderful village which has retained most of its original Portuguese charm and character.

"Beaches":"Beaches",
"The beach of Altura (Alagoa) is the sun worshipper’s paradise with white expansive sands and good water for swimming. Located at the bottom end of the village, the beach can be reached in easily on foot or by car. The car park can get quite busy in high season though. The beach offers amenities including sunbeds, shade, and some water sports in high season. There are also a couple of excellent fish restaurants to try. For those who enjoy walking, the coastline is long and easy to navigate with the neighboring resorts of Praia Verde and Monte Gordo all within around 30 minutes walk. Cabeco Beach is directly next door - The entrance is a bit hidden away and consequently, access isn't as busy. There is another great restaurant here where you can dine right on the edge of the ocean Praia Verde - The entrance to Praia Verde beach is from above - you will need a car and be prepared to walk down the steps to reach the sands. Its name (translated as the 'Green Beach') is derived from the fact that it is unusually bordered by a lovely crest of pine trees, which makes the setting private. Gorgeous sands and a couple of lovely restaurants to try here. For the sun worshippers, there are sunbeds for hire and for those who enjoy walking, the beach is long and flat and its around 30 minutes on foot to Monte Gordo and Altura.":"The beach of Altura (Alagoa) is the sun worshipper’s paradise with white expansive sands and good water for swimming. Located at the bottom end of the village, the beach can be reached in easily on foot or by car. The car park can get quite busy in high season though. The beach offers amenities including sunbeds, shade, and some water sports in high season. There are also a couple of excellent fish restaurants to try. For those who enjoy walking, the coastline is long and easy to navigate with the neighboring resorts of Praia Verde and Monte Gordo all within around 30 minutes walk.

"Castro Marim":"Castro Marim",
"Castro Marim is an unspoiled location with a typical Eastern Algarve charm. The narrow streets are filled with character and have a choice of restaurants, bars, and cafes. The key feature of this town is the Castle which is open to the public and is at least worth a visit to sample the fabulous views which stretch right across Spain and the Guadiana River. If you happen to be visiting at the end of August, for 4 days each year, Castro Marim takes a leap back into the past for its Medieval Days festival. Enter the castle and you enter another, older world. A truly fantastic and different experience.":"Castro Marim is an unspoiled location with a typical Eastern Algarve charm.

"Manta Rota is a small village which is very popular with the Portuguese in high season and longer-term renters in the winter months. Part of its attraction is the huge long beach that can be reached on foot, and its charming selection of Portuguese restaurants and café bars. In the summer months, there are activities at the beach as well as market stalls and open-air entertainments in the evening, but out of season, Manta Rota is a sleepy hollow! There is a good choice of restaurants, all of which can be recommended, and which vary in style of cuisine and price. The village is compact and has within easy reach a supermarket, butchers, bakers, and newsagent. Overall, it’s fair to say that there is not much else in Manta Rota – which probably the reason why people who holiday there love it – ‘simplicity is divinity’! – Manta Rota is the ideal place to experience a typical Portuguese holiday, with only the beach for company during the day. Vila Nova Cacela is around 1km from Manta Rota and has more shops and restaurants to offer.":"Manta Rota is a small village which is very popular with the Portuguese in high season and longer-term renters in the winter months.
